# Resume Screening Tool 📄✨

An AI/ML-based application that automatically screens resumes and classifies them into suitable categories to assist recruiters in shortlisting candidates efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Automated Screening**: Uses Machine Learning classification to filter resumes.  
- **Customizable Criteria**: Define rules for job role, skills, or experience level.  
- **UI/UX Integration**: Simple front-end for recruiters to upload and view results.  
- **Efficiency**: Reduces manual screening time by over 50%.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, NLTK (for text processing)  
- **Notebook**: Jupyter / Google Colab  
- **Other**: Streamlit (optional for UI demo)  

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Based on a curated dataset of resumes with fields such as **Category, Skills, Education, Experience, Resume Text**.  
- Preprocessed using text cleaning, tokenization, and feature extraction (TF-IDF).  

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and tokenized resume text.  
   - Applied TF-IDF vectorization.  

2. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM).  
   - Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

3. **Prediction & Screening**  
   - Input: Resume text (PDF/Docx).  
   - Output: Predicted category (e.g., Data Science, Web Developer, HR, etc.).  

4. **UI/UX Layer (Optional)**  
   - Streamlit-based simple interface for uploading resumes and viewing results.  

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved **~85-90% accuracy** on test data depending on model.  
- Reduced recruiter screening time significantly by automating categorization.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Integration with ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).  
- Enhanced NLP pipeline with BERT/Transformer-based models.  
- Multi-class + ranking system to suggest best-fit candidates.
